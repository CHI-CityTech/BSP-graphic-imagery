Welcome to the BSP Graphic Imagery archive, where we store the visual pieces that bring our show to life. Storytelling isn’t just about words—it’s about the images that shape the world and deepen the experience. Our team works closely with the head scriptwriter to create detailed backgrounds and handcrafted puppets, making each scene feel real. This archive is both a record of our work and a resource for future projects, keeping our creative vision alive.
